The world of machine learning is ever growing and with the advancements in the fields of computer vision and NLP, it is starting to replicate the actions of human beings, if not out-perform us. One such task is sentiment classification. There are various libraries in python that can be used to identify the sentiments from texts, like TextBlob, Gensim, NLTK, but, this task gets a bit tedious and cumbersome when it comes to audio files, i.e., sentiment classifcation for audio files. I have tried an approach for classifying the sentiments from audio files using features like mfcc and chroma. The model has been trained and tested on a dataset containing various features extracted from audio files. The image shows the model predicting the sentiment for the input file, which is the monologue of Nana Patekar from Krantiveer.
